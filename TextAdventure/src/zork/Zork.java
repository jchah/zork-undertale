//Hi Mr. Deslauriers it is currently 10:41 pm on the fourth of june and Jad kicked me out from our 
//groupchat so I'm sorry but I can not complete any more work as I'm not sure what work we have left
//or not because we have the list in the groupchat. I still have like 40 commits and did so much work but this is it for me. Sayonara.
